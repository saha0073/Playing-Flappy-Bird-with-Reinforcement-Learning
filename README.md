This repo contains Flappy Bird game in which a neural network has been trained to play Flappy Bird game itself using reinforcement learning (RL).  

## Techniques Used
* GameEngine: Unity3D 20.3
* Modeling Techniques: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning
* Tech Stack: C#
* Libraries: ML-Agents Release 10, ML-Agents Extensions Release 10
* Unity tools: Ray Perception Sensor 3D, UI, Prefab, GameManager, Sprites, etc


## A demo of playing Flappy Bird with RL!

* Several demo of game view are also available in the `./Recordings` folder


## Getting Started
### To Run the Unity application
* Clone this repo, and open the project in Unity. Here I used Unity 20.3.
* Go into the package manager and please make sure the project have ML-Agents Release 10, and Input System 1.1.0-preview.3  
* Now open the SampleScene_AgentSetup, and hit play. The trained model should play the Flappy Bird game
