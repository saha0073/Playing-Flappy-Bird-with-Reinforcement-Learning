This repo contains a wide range of custom functions & UI code for real-time detection & analysis of objects using YOLOv4. The UI can take a video (or CCTV streaming) as input, and will stream the output object detection in UI, along with time series count. Ready for deployment in the GPU servers for real-time custom object detection.

## Techniques Used
* GameEngine: Unity3D 20.3
* Modeling Techniques: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning
* Tech Stack: C#
* Libraries: ML-Agents Release 10, ML-Agents Extensions Release 10
* Unity tools: Ray Perception Sensor 3D, UI, Prefab, GameManager, Sprites, etc

## Getting Started
### To Run the Unity application
* Clone this repo, and open the project in Unity. Here I used Unity 20.3.
* Go into the package manager and please make sure the project have ML-Agents Release 10, and Input System 1.1.3-preview  
* Now open the SampleScene_AgentSetup, and hit play. The trained model should play the Flappy Bird game
